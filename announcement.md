Hello everyone.  

The Collaboratory is pleased announce a 2-day Software Carpentry Workshop to be presented Thursday and Friday, February 21-22.

As part of larger data science efforts on campus, the Collaboratory will be hosting a 2-day Software Carpentry Workshop to be presented Thursday and Friday, February 21-22. The Library is thrilled to collaborate with Enterprise Technology Services (ETS), Center for Scientific Computing (CSC), and the department of Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology (EEMB) to help present this workshop.

Software Carpentry aims to help researchers get their work done in less time and with less pain by teaching them basic research computing skills. This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools, including command line scripting, version control, data management, and task automation with the R statistical programming language. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.

This workshop is targeted at novice users.  The only requirement is that you can successfully install and configure software on your own laptop before arriving at the workshop.  We welcome all UCSB students, faculty, and staff with an interest in learning today’s research computing tools.  

Registration is required and limited to 25.  For more information, and a link to the registration form, please see:
